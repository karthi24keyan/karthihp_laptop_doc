Dear sir,

Now the Docs folder have pushed to git space (Edge_documentation). 

Earlier error happened because another .git directory (pointed https://github.com/AnthonyDamian/docs.git) placed inside the docs directory. so i just removed .git directory. now you can pull and push.

Please find the attached new document
